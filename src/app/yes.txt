Below is a basic example, using your HTML structure with additional CSS for the 3D effect and a touch of JavaScript to handle the rotation on hover: ### Explanation: - **Perspective:** The property is applied to the container that holds the card, which gives the rotated card a 3D effect. A higher value reduces the intensity of the 3D effect. - **Transform-style and backface-visibility:** These CSS properties are used to create the 3D effect and make sure that only one side of the card is visible at a time. - **Transition & Transform:** The transition allows smooth animation when rotating, and the transform property is used to rotate the card when hovered. - **Structure:** The card has two faces: the front and back. The back face is rotated by 180 degrees to show alternate content. - **Hover Effect:** You can adjust the event to mouse click or touch as per your requirement. This setup allows for a card that rotates to reveal more information on the back when hovered over. You can replace the content and styles to fit your design needs
